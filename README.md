# Plague Quote Generator

I had to build a random quote generator for the freeCodeCamp Frontend Frameworks track.

I made it during March 2020 as the global coronavirus pandemic was underway. It's kinda grim but in many ways it made me think about all the books about the Black Death that I'd read, and how the situation was eerily similar in some respects.

Made with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
