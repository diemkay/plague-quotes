# Plague Quote Generator

I had to build a random quote generator for the freeCodeCamp Frontend Frameworks track.

I made it during March 2020 as the global coronavirus pandemic was underway. It's kinda grim but in many ways it made me think about all the books about the Black Death that I'd read, and how the situation was eerily similar in some respects.

## Highlights

It was the first time I had to put something together bigger than a few words and divs, inside a course:

- ES Modules
- Class-based components and state management
- Hosting with Netlify
- Composing an app with components: separating the logic from the display

Made with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
